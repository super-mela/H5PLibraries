# h5p-topic-map

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build:prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build:dev
```

## Semantics

When adding new fields to H5P's `semantics.json`, never change `semantics.json` itself, but rather update `./src/semantics.ts` and run `npm run generate-semantics` afterwards. This ensures strict typing of semantics.

For semantics generation watch mode, run `npm run watch-semantics`.

## Running

Open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```
